# Welcome to the Spotijava application

## *completed by Leslie Gaines, Merian Kawera, Eric Erichsen, DeVon Thompson*

*This is the Final project of the 8 week Java Web Development Bootcamp under America's Promise Grant and Montgomery College.*
*We created a purchasing music application that we dubbed 'Spotijava'(after Spotify).*

## Project Details

1.The user has to input login information as well deposit money in order to purchase music.

2.Then the user is transferred to album library and clicks their user ID at the top.

3.The user can select as many albums they would like with the amount that they deposited.

4.The user will then refresh the page and the updated remaining balance will be displayed. 

5.The user goes to songs available in order to view songs that they purchased.

*there is an admin page and if the user is an admin they will be to add albums to the main library and remove albums from the main
library*

*user receives a 10% discount for albums purchased over $50*
